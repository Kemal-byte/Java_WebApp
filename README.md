## 1. Intro

In this repository, I have attempted to create a web application that register users and login them. It took more time than I would like to admit but I am happy with the results.


Main pages are Registration, Login and Homepage.
It is still not complete yet but so far it can add users into 
the database.

Next step will be implementing login page.

Additionally, I might add some features like;
+ 2 steps verification via (Email, Google Authentication etc.)
+ Custom error pages.
